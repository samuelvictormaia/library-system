# 📚 Library Management System

A simple yet efficient **TypeScript-based Library Management System**, designed to demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, async operations, and structured error handling.  

This project was developed as part of my **Front-End Developer training (BFD 2025)**, focusing on clean architecture, maintainability, and modern coding standards.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript  
- **Runtime:** Node.js  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Key Concepts:** Classes, Async/Await, Promises, Error Handling, Map Collections  

---

## 🧩 Features

- Add books to a digital library collection  
- Borrow books asynchronously (simulating database delay)  
- Return borrowed books with validation  
- Prevent duplicate entries and invalid returns  
- Display all books with availability status

## 🧠 Core Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Each book is represented as a `Book` class with private and controlled properties. |
| **Abstraction** | The `BookManager` class manages all library logic through clean, reusable methods. |
| **Async Simulation** | Borrowing and returning use Promises to simulate async data operations. |
| **Error Handling** | Robust validation and clear feedback for invalid or duplicate actions. |
